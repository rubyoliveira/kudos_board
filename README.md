### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Sort of, I felt a disconnect when actually coding the backend from our tutorials, I also feel many were rushed and didn't have enough time to finish this completely. But the topics discussed were helpful I just wish we had more tutorials and videos to help guide us.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I think I would've started on the backend earlier with what I knew about prisma, since the backend took me a while to set up and understand how to work with it. I think if I realized the labs could guide me through the beginning steps I could've started a lot earlier and been able to add comments, since deployment wasn't working since we had limited times to deploy.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think I would like to implement more unique css styling and making the website more my own and adding some fun features.

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Shout out to Tessa and Axel for really helping me out with figuring out the backend since I was quite confused at first and am really thankful for their support and help. Also a thank you to Sammy the instructor who always is very helpful when needing assitance in something he also showed me how to automatically update my backend with nodemon.
